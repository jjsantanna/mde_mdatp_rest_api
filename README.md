# Playing with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) (previous MDATP) REST API 
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks **mde_mdatp_rest_api_functions.ipynb** and **fun_part_calling_functions.ipynb**. As their names say, the first only defines some functions that I've decided to implement and the second file calls the functions. Have fun!
